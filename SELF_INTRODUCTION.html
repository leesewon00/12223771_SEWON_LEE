    Hello, I'm Lee Sewon.
I am majoring in computer engineering at Inha University.
I like to travel with my friends, and I like to visit famous restaurants.
And I often watch popular dramas and TV programs. These days, I am into “환승연애”. It is a love variety program, and I often talk about it with my friends.
Also, MBTI is popular these days, and my MBTI is ESTJ!
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a few things I want to achieve through this class.
First, I want to make new friends through various communication.
Second, I want to have confidence in English. I thought I was not good at English, so I tended to avoid it when it comes to English, but I want to be more confident in English through this class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s talk about my hopes and dreams.
I want to be a successful CEO as an IT developer in the future.
I majored in chemical engineering and changed my major to computer engineering in order to live doing what I wanted to do. Like this, I want to continue to do what I want to do in the future.
Also, I want to earn a lot of money and live a rich life like many people's dreams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for reading my introduction.
See you next week.
